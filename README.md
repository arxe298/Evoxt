# Evoxt Promo Codes and Latest Evoxt High-Performance VPS Deals for 2026

## Evoxt Introduction

So here's the thing about Evoxt. They showed up in 2020 with a pretty straightforward pitch: what if you could get seriously fast virtual machines without having to explain to your boss why the hosting bill looks like a mortgage payment?

The company's headquartered in Malaysia, but don't let that fool you—they've got data centers scattered across 16 locations worldwide. We're talking US, UK, Canada, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, and more. The founder had been messing around with virtual machines since 2015, learning the ropes at different companies, before deciding to go all-in on this venture.

What makes Evoxt kind of interesting is their obsession with CPU clock speed. While a lot of providers are playing the "more cores!" game, Evoxt went the other direction. All their virtual machines run on CPUs with at least 3.5 GHz base clock, with some hitting up to 6.0 GHz turbo. For certain workloads—web hosting, app development, gaming servers—that single-core performance really matters.

The platform runs on KVM hypervisors with enterprise-grade hardware. They promise 99.99% uptime, throw in weekly automatic offsite backups at no extra cost, and can get your VM deployed in about 2.5 minutes. Their control panel is clean and actually makes sense, which is rarer than you'd think in this industry.

They're also big on transparency. If you order a $2.99 plan, you pay $2.99. No sneaky bandwidth fees, no CPU burst charges, no "gotcha" moments on your invoice. Plus they accept cryptocurrency if you're privacy-conscious.

## Evoxt Reviews

Let's be real about what people are actually saying about Evoxt. The reviews are interesting because you get a pretty consistent picture across different platforms.

On VPSBenchmarks, Evoxt has been recognized in their "Best VPS" rankings multiple times. They snagged 2nd place in the "Best VPS 2025 under $25" category and 3rd place in "Best VPS 2024 under $25." The benchmark tests showed strong single-core performance, which tracks with their high-frequency CPU focus. Their consistency score is solid, meaning you're likely to get similar performance regardless of which server you land on.

The performance tests paint a good picture. CPU benchmarks show excellent single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. Disk I/O with SSDs delivers consistent read/write speeds suitable for most applications. Network tests, particularly from their Tokyo datacenter, show strong connectivity for Asia-Pacific users. The 24-hour endurance tests revealed stable performance with minimal resource contention.

Customer feedback from various review sites is generally positive, with a few recurring themes:

**The Good Stuff:**
- The interface is genuinely intuitive. Multiple reviewers mentioned being surprised at how clean and easy to navigate the control panel is, even for people without a technical background.
- Speed is noticeable. People running websites on the VM-1 plan report quick database queries and fast page loads.
- The deployment is actually as fast as advertised—around 2.5 minutes.
- Customer support via Telegram is responsive. Most urgent tickets get attention quickly.
- The pricing really is transparent. People appreciate not getting hit with surprise charges.

**The Not-So-Good Stuff:**
- Support can be inconsistent. While Telegram support is usually quick, the ticket system can be hit-or-miss depending on issue complexity.
- Some users reported occasional billing hiccups, though these generally get resolved.
- The dedicated server offering is still new (launched in Q3 2024), so there's limited long-term feedback on that service.
- Geographic expansion is slow—dedicated servers are still Malaysia-only.

From community forums, one user summed it up nicely: "I came across Evoxt through a Google search, needed a website setup. Used their automatic application deployment with detailed guides. I don't have any programming background, but I got everything set up easily. They are absolutely great."

Another mentioned: "My website runs fast on Evoxt VPS! Only with just 1 core! Database queries are quick as well."

For gaming and Discord bot hosting, users report smooth performance: "I did not know VPS can be so fast at such prices. I use Evoxt VPS to host my Discord bot, smooth. Money well spent."

The consensus seems to be: Evoxt delivers on the core promise of high CPU performance at competitive prices. The interface is user-friendly, deployment is quick, and for single-threaded workloads, the performance genuinely stands out. Support quality varies, and some growing pains are evident, but for the price point, most users feel they're getting solid value.

For users considering Evoxt, the recommendation is pretty clear: start with one of the smaller VM plans to test the waters. The VM-1 or VM-2 plans are popular entry points. If you need dedicated hardware, keep an eye on their expansion plans, but the VMs are the proven offering right now.
